# Wine Quality Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to figure out which independent variables in the dataset that can be use to predict the quality of a bottle of wine. Mulitple linear regreesion will be used for this analysis.

Multiple linear regression is a statistical model that uses not only one, but multiple independent variables to predict the outcome of the dependent variable. We will see whether each independent variable has a significant relationship with the dependent variable as well as take a look at the R-squared value of the model to see how much variability of the dependent varibale is accounted by the independent variables. We will then also conduct a best subset technique to choose the best subset of predictors with the highest R-squared value.
